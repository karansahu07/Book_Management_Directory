# Book_Management_Directory

#This application allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) records of books stored in a JSON file (books.json). By leveraging Node.js's built-in modules (http, fs, url, and path), the server efficiently handles HTTP requests, manages data persistence, and serves static files when needed.
